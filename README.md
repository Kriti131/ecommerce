**Project Overview:**
Developed a robust food delivery and e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project focuses on creating a seamless user experience through a well-designed frontend, efficient backend, and secure data management.

**Key Features:**

MERN Stack Configuration: Established a powerful development environment integrating MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
IDE Setup: Configured a suitable Integrated Development Environment for frontend (React) and backend (Node.js and Express) development, ensuring a cohesive coding environment.
Frontend Development: Crafted responsive React components for Home, My Orders, Cart, Login/Logout, and Admin screens, prioritizing modern user interface design.
Backend Development: Implemented Node.js and Express.js for robust backend development, defining RESTful API endpoints for browsing, ordering, and managing food items.
Database Integration: Integrated MongoDB Atlas cloud database, ensuring proper organization and retrieval of data for food items, orders, and user information.
Data Import: Simulated a realistic testing environment by importing sample data into MongoDB Atlas, encompassing food items, user details, and order information.
Security Implementation: Implemented secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt.js. Integrated Express Validator to validate user inputs, enhancing overall application security.
